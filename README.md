## Goals:
Divorce rates have been increasing in the United States over the past several decades. In order to understand this phenomena in a tangible way, we develop an ensemble model to predict the marital status of American individuals - as either divorced or married. The feature importances surfaced through the prediction model are informative for further social and economic research as well as public programming.
